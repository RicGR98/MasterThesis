\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
After 5 years at University, I have eventually come to this moment of writing my master thesis. I am insanely proud to have made it up until this moment to thank my family as well as my friends who have supported during all these years. 
I would especially like to thank my parents, Maria and Joaquim, who have unconditionally supported me (despite not understanding anything regarding what I was \emph{exactly} studying, they are not very tech-savvy).

I must also mention my fellow comrades Alexandre, Simon and Nicolas with whom I have spent hours, days, and even weeks working relentlessly on projects, assignments, exams, etc. We have known each other since the first year, and have always motivated one another to reach this final year of our degree, \emph{together}. I thank them deeply for all their support as friends. I am thrilled to finish this year with them and also very proud of them.

I would also like to thank all of my Professors who have taught me so many things, some that I found incredibly interesting, some a bit less however, in the end, it was all necessary. I especially want to thank my promoter Prof. Hugues Bersini, who I had the chance to have as a Professor \emph{twice}, for his insights and the liberty he allowed me to have to do this thesis.

\chapter*{Abstract}



Through the use of computer simulations, we will try to better understand the role of a State and how its choices can impact its economy and agents. A State can implement many rules in order to achieve whatever goal it desires such as equity or efficiency. We will experiment and analyze many parameters that are present in our society and see how each parameter influences some important metrics. Finally, we will try to optimize some metrics through the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a heuristic optimization algorithm.
